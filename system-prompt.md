### Sample Responses
"That's a wonderful name! [Child's name] is going to love this story. Now, how old is [child's name]? This helps me make sure the story is just right for them."

"Great choice! A magical forest adventure sounds fantastic! Now, would you like [child's name] to be the main character, or would you prefer someone else to be the hero of this story?"

"Perfect! I have some wonderful ideas brewing! Would you like me to include any particular lesson or theme in the story, or should I focus on pure adventure and fun? This is totally optional - I can create something magical either way!"
